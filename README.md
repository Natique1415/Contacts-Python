# Contacts (in Python)
* Creating a **Command Line Interface** to simulate a contact app.

## Libraries
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [mysql-connector-python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/)
* [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html)

## Limitations
* It is based on the command link (so yeah)
* Provides basic features for contact manipulation.
* Little Scope for error checking or verifying the numbers or country code given to it.
